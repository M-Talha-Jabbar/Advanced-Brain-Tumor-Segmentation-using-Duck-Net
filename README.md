# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Segmentation using DUCK-Net

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on automating brain tumor detection in MRI scans using the DUCK-Net deep learning architecture and the BraTS dataset. The objective is to build a system that can accurately segment and outline tumor regions to assist radiologists in making faster, more consistent diagnostic decisions, reducing reliance on time-consuming manual analysis.

## ðŸ§ª Problem Statement
Segmenting brain tumors from MRI scans manually is time-intensive and subject to interpretation variability. This project addresses this challenge using a deep learning model that performs precise and automated segmentation, identifying key tumor subregions like the enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- DUCK-Net Architecture
- BraTS Dataset
- Deep Learning
- Image Segmentation

## ðŸ“Š Project Highlights
- Leveraged BraTS dataset with multimodal MRI scans (T1, T1CE, T2, FLAIR).
- Implemented DUCK-Net using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Trained the model to segment tumor regions from 3D volumes.
- Evaluated performance using Dice Coefficient and Intersection over Union (IoU).
- Visualized predicted vs. ground truth segmentation masks for validation.

## ðŸ”„ Project Workflow
1. MRI Data preprocessing and normalization  
2. Dataset splitting for training, validation, and testing  
3. Model definition and training using DUCK-Net  
4. Evaluation and visualization of segmentation performance

## ðŸ§  DUCK-Net Architecture

The architecture used for this project is DUCK-Net â€” a specialized convolutional neural network designed for high-precision biomedical image segmentation. It incorporates dense skip connections and optimized downsampling/upsampling blocks to preserve spatial features.
